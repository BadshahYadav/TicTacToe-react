## Overview

A classic 2-player game implemented on a 3Ã—3 grid where players alternate turns to place "X" or "O". The first to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game results in a draw. Simple logic and conditions are used to check for winning combinations and game completion.

The app focuses on delivering a smooth, responsive, and user-friendly experience, making learning and self-assessment both fun and engaging.
